This is a Python-based implementation of the popular game "Connect Four". The game is played between two players, taking turns to drop colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The objective of the game is to form a line of four discs of the same color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game is built using the Pygame library and NumPy for the game logic.

## Features:

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Pygame.
- Button interaction for starting the game and quitting the game.
- On-screen text for game descriptions and other details.
- Player's turn indication with colored tokens.
- Game over scenario when a player forms a line of four tokens.
- Winning player announcement after each game.

- A message will be displayed announcing the winner.
- After the game ends, you can start a new game by clicking "Game Start" again or quit the game by clicking "Quit".

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
